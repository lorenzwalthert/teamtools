# teamtools

The goal of teamtools is to facilitate team work and content organisation 
if the following directory structure is present:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
team
|- project 1
|   |- repository 1
|   |- repository 2
|- project 2
    |- repository 3
    |- repository 4
```

Such a project structure is common for teams working on BitBucket. Every
repository is technically an independent git repo. If you use another remote
git client you can anyways organize different repos in projects under a team
root. Note that a team root is characterized by a directory having a `.team` 
file.

# README structuring

teamtools suggests that a repository's description is stored in `.description`. 
Such a description is a concise statement about what the content / goal of 
the repository is.
This description may be used in the Rmd README by placing 
` r teamtools::read_and_markdown_description_files(category = "repo")` 
(enclosed in back ticks) 
anywhere in the README to import the description. You can use markdown
syntax in the `.description` as this will be placed into the README as is before
compiled with Pandoc.
Projects can also have such descriptions, and they can be read with the above
command, setting `category = "project"`.

The following description for repos was generated with the command mentioned 
above:

`r teamtools::read_local_description()`


***

The advantage of this approach is that these short descriptions can be 
accessed easily programmatically, much easier than if we had to parse 
a README and extract the first paragraph or something like that. 
You can easily retrieve all descriptions from all repos in all projects with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
teamtools::read_description_files()
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   repo      project   desc                                                                                          
#>   <chr>     <chr>     <chr>                                                                                         
#> 1 titanic   companion "In this repo, the famous ...
#> 2 meta      meta      "This is a \nmultiline des...
#> 3 sandbox84 meta      sandbox to try how things ...
```

Note that this works if your current working directory is *any* directory
under the team root.

In the future, we aim to support files other than `.description` to represent
other meta data.

# Utilities

There are a bunch of other utility functions.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
find_repo_root()
find_team_root()
read_description_file("project-1", "repository-1")
read_local_description()
```
